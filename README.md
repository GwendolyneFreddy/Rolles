#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **setup-rolles.exe**, uninstall the previously installed main component and delete the rolles folder.</em>

<em>When installing or uninstalling, **do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a rolles folder and a setup-rolles.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **setup-rolles.exe** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **setup-rolles.exe** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Uninstallation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using **`setup-rolles --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
